After upgrading my iMac to Mavericks I found out that my python environment was
totally messed up, notably with ipython and virtualenv crashing at launch. I
ended up to use my laptop to keep on with python development until I decided to
perform a fresh install of the whole programming environment. I found out a
wonderful [blog post](http://
joernhees.de/blog/2014/02/25/scientific-python-on-mac-os-x-10-9-with-homebrew)
detailing all the steps needed to organize such an install via [homebrew](
http://http://brew.sh).
