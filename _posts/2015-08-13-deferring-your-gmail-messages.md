I finally found out a way to defer messages in Gmail. I wanted to be able to
remove a mail message from my inbox and let it automatically show up after
N days, in order to directly implement the *defer* and *delegate* basic
[GTD actions](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) directly within Gmail.

The process is quite easy also for a novice in programming. Basically,
everything boils up in terms of writing a GDoc script to be automatically
triggered, for instance, nightly. All details in this

at the Google apps developer blog. Enjoy deferring!
